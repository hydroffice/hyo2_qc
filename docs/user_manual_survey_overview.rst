    single: survey review

The **Survey Validation** tab will:

* Receive bathymetric grids and feature file inputs for analysis (see :ref:`survey-data-inputs`).

* Scan grids for anomalous grid data ":index:`fliers`" (see :ref:`survey-flier-finder`).

* Scan grids for empty grid nodes that meet NOAA NOS Hydrographic Survey Specifications and Deliverables (`HSSD`_) definitions of ":index:`holidays`" (see :ref:`survey-detect-holidays`).

* Compute basic grid statistics to ensure compliance to uncertainty and density requirements prescribed in the HSSD (see :ref:`survey-grid-qa`).

* Scan grids to ensure the eligibility of soundings :index:`designated` (see :ref:`survey-scan-designated-label`).

* Scan features to ensure proper attribution (see :ref:`survey-scan-features`).

* Ensure surveyed features are properly accounted for in the :index:`gridded bathymetry` (see :ref:`survey-valsou-checks`).

* Export :index:`bottom samples` to a text file for archival (see :ref:`survey-sbdare-export`).

* Ensure the survey deliverables and directory structure are complete and meet requirements prescribed in the HSSD. (see :ref:`survey-submission-checks`).
