RorI: Your Rock-or-Islet Oracle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
|

How To Use?
"""""""""""

|

**RorI** has been created as a tool to help hydrographers determine if their feature is a rock or an islet. RorI is a standalone
tool that is launched from the button at the top of the Info tab.

How Does It Work?
"""""""""""""""""

|

At the top of RorI there are three toggles. In 2019, NOAA's Marine Chart Division updated how to define the WATLEV of 
rocks and redefined when a rock becomes an islet. 

Pre-2019, how rocks and islets were defined depends upon where you were surveying due to
the tidal range that occurs in these areas. NOAA had three discrete regions: The East Coast (including the Gulf Coast),
the West Coast (including Alaska), and the Great Lakes. The user will set the first toggle depending on the location of
their survey.

For 2019 and beyond, the definition has been unified from coast to coast. The only difference between the three options in the second toggle is that the Great Lakes region is referenced to LWD. 

The third toggle does not have an impact on how RorI is doing its calculations. The toggle controls two visualizations.
First, the boxes below which show you the math being used to define the different WATLEV values. You can either view
these values in an elevation (positive up) or depth (positive down). The boxes below show the math behind of each WATLEV
value which are derived from NOAA's Hydrographic Specifications and Deliverables for their respective years.

The user will then enter two very important pieces of information: the MHW value and the depth of the feature. The hydrographer
will retrieve the MHW value from their tide note. The feature shall be tidally corrected and be referenced to MLLW. That
means all depths above MLLW shall be negative! Note for the Great Lakes, all data is referenced to LWD, therefore there
is no input needed by the user.

Next, RorI will crunch the numbers and tell you if your feature is a rock or islet. If it is a rock, it will
let you know its depth (VALSOU) and water level effect (WATLEV). If your feature is an islet, it will reference the elevation
(ELEVAT) to MHW (LWD for the Great Lakes).

RorI does not use magic to calculate the difference between a rock or and islet. What it does is some simple math. The tool
compares the depth to the MHW value (or LWD for the Great Lakes) which are both entered by the user. If the rock is higher in elevation than the following values,
then it is an islet.

RorI is based on the following specifications:

* **HSSD 2018**:

  * Atlantic Coast: 0.3048 m
  * Pacific Coast: 0.6096 m
  * Great Lakes: 1.2192 m
        
* **HSSD 2019+**:

  * All regions: 0.1 m

RorI also helps the hydrographer visualize the difference between a rock and an islet for their survey using a graphic.

Uncertainty Calculator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|

How To Use?
"""""""""""
|

**Uncertainty Calculator** is a standalone tool to help you calculate the total vertical uncertainty and total horizontal
uncertainty of hydrographic data.

To launch the tool, click the button at the top of the Info tab.

The user can toggle between Special Order, Order 1, and Order 2 requirements.

The user inputs the depth and displayed below are the results of both the IHO and NOAA Specifications.

IHO and NOAA TVU calculations are identical per S-44 and the Hydrographic Survey Specifications and Deliverables.

.. math::

    TVU\, QC = Uncertainty / \sqrt{a^2 + (b * depth)^2}

where:

* :math:`a = 0.25 m, b = 0.0075` for Special Order
* :math:`a = 0.5 m, b = 0.013` for Order 1 (depths less than 100 m)
* :math:`a = 1.0 m, b = 0.023` for Order 2 (depths greater than 100 m)

IHO and NOAA THU utilize the same formula but with different variables.

.. math::

    THU\, QC = Â±(k + p * depth)

where:

* IHO:

  * Special Order: where :math:`k = 2 m, p = 0 pct`
  * Order 1: where :math:`k = 5 m, p = 5 pct`
  * Order 2: where :math:`k = 20 m, p = 10 pct`

* NOAA:

  * All Orders: where :math:`k = 5 m, p = 5 pct`

The graph at the bottom of the tool is interactive and visually represents the total vertical and total horizontal
uncertainties at that order.
